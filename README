This script is a helper for installing the Oracle Instant Client for Mac OS X.

It has been tested with the Oracle Instant Client 11.2 series for 64 bit intel architecture.
Using this script takes all the necessary steps to allow Perl's DBD::Oracle to install
properly from CPAN.

Prerequisites:
	1) Install X Code
	2) Install X Code commandline tools
	3) Download the Oracle Instant Client .zip files,
		At minimum you probably want the SDK, BASIC and SQLPLUS.

		*** It doesn't matter where you download them to, leaving them in
	Downloads is fine.  Make sure you run this script as whatever user downloaded
	the install files.

Instructions
	Run the following command from your Terminal.app, it will prompt you for your
	password, as this requires admin priveleges to install:

	\curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/klkane/macosx_oracle_instantclient_installer/master/installer.sh | bash 

Testing/Usage

	Close and reopen Terminal.app and now you should be able to use Oracle 
Instant Client from the commandline.  Try using sqlplus.
